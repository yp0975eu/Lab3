 Problem 2:

 Look on the Internet for failed software projects.  You are looking for software projects that the final project was never used, or it didn’t deliver what was promised, or ended up costing 20 times the original estimate, or abandoned after lots of money was spent on it.

 Look for analysis of why these projects failed – what reasons can you find?

 This will be useful as research for Assignment 3.
